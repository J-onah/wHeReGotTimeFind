## Collaborating
When working on a new feature, create a new branch in the following format:
```
<name>-<featurename>
```
Eg. `ian-search`

Submit a Pull Request (PR) to the `main` branch using the GitHub website
```
Repo main page > Pull requests > New pull request
```
The `base` branch should be `main` and the `compare` branch should be your branch.
